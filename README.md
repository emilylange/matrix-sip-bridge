# matrix-sip-bridge
A bridge between [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and VoIP via [SIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) to answer (and in future make) phone calls from Matrix.

## Please be aware, that this is considered **early stage software**
There may or may not be a lot of bugs and breaking changes.
